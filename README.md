# Smartrobe!

Fashion is one of the biggest markets in the world. "Up to 100 billion garments are produced by the fashion industry every year, each year, as much as 92 million tons of clothing ends up in landfills" (source: https://theroundup.org/textile-waste-statistics/). Of course, it creates a huge waste of resources and increases CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, clothing companies still create new collections of clothes in huge quantities, convincing people that they need them. Meanwhile, our closets are already full of "must have’s" from previous seasons, many of them rarely worn. Sometimes it's our problem too.

The project is created to help people minimize their closets, make them buy less (very often useless and incompatible) clothes, and finally have
a wardrobe only with things that meet their real needs and preferences. In the app, the users could register their own clothes, their colors and models. Any time a specific piece is worn, the user can note it in the application with one click. Based on this data, the app would create a wearing statiscits, to show to user an actual usability of clothes. 

In order to setup the project, please proceed as follows:

```bash
  npm install my-project
```

After successful installation use the following command to run the project:

```bash
  npm run
```
## Examples

You can see a brief overview of how to use the main functionality below

```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

function App() {
  return <Component />
}
```
